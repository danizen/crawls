## Description ##

These are some nifty crawls using anemone ruby gem to get a handle on the size and scope
of some of the web properties at my place of employment, NLM.

## Using it ##

- Best to install rvm and ruby 
- With this tiny thing, you can get away with system ruby as long as you install rubygems (RHEL/CentOS 6.x):

    sudo yum -y install ruby rubygems

- Either way, you then do this

    gem install anemone

- And then you can run these, but please use care - they spider my workplace

## Potential Roadmap ##

- Find some way to feed binary data to Apache Solr with rsolr ruby gem
- Build it into a cronfigurable crawler and internal reporting tool with a combination of
    + activeadmin ruby gem 
    + blacklight ruby gem
